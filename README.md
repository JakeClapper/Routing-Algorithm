**Unit Tests**
* Created Unit Tests that compared the output to the expected output. The test would pass if the addresses matched, otherwise it would fail. 
* Unit tests are essential because they ensure the quality of the software. Unit tests verify parts of the code to ensure that there are no regressions.
* When changes are made, unit tests are also helpful for developement. Because they can help identify problems that the developer testing did not reveal.
